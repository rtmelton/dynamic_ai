In time, this will be a place to post ideas concerning dynamic artificial intelligence.  This is in contrast to the old waterfall-type neural networks, like the perceptron. They were used for looking at static snapshots, but that is about as far as they really went. Decades later, perceptrons got renamed deep learning. Basically, the Linsker experiments. Nothing wrong with that.
