In time, this will be a place to post ideas concerning dynamic artificial intelligence.  This is in contrast to waterfall-type neural networks like the old perceptron. They were used for looking at static snapshots, but that's about as far as they really went. They got renamed deep learning, but renaming them didn't increase their ability any. It might have made them sound more prestigious.
